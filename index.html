<p>
    
    Helping Hands is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving those most at-risk to COVID-19:<br/>
    <br/>
    senior citizens, the immune compromised, and people with pre-existing medical conditions which put them at additional risk. <br/>
Our community volunteers and delivery partners deliver groceries, medicine, and other necessary supplies to empower everyone to stay healthy and be as responsible as they can be.
